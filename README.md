# odin-recipes

Creating a basic website with my favourite recipes. 
This website will be built based on the foundational knowledge learnt
    through The Odin Project and I've learnt:
    - How to build a basic HTML boilerplate
    - Incorporate headings 
    - Placing in img and links to other website
        - Absolute links 
        - Relative links
    - Naming conventions for different files and folders
        - Including file organisation
    - How to utilise git commits effectively.
